                            <h4 class="text-center">Quark</h4>
                            <p>Before opening a bar, known as Quark's, on the station, Quark served as a cook aboard a Ferengi freighter for eight years. Quark came to the
                                 station while it was named Terok Nor during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. Originally, Quark admired the Cardassian race for their 
                                 version of morality, but later he seemed to take pity on the downtrodden Bajoran people, selling them food and equipment just above cost, 
                                 which could have gotten him into serious trouble if the Cardassians had found out. 
                               Quark nevertheless continued to conduct a variety of shady deals while on the station, but neither Sisko nor the Bajoran authorities took 
                               many punitive actions against him, partially because Quark's position in the station's business community and contribution to station tourism
                                outweighed the trouble caused by his activities, which were legal under Ferengi law and, for the most part, harmed no one. This was also largely
                                 because of the Federation's policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other races, which extended even to the Ferengi and their
                                  business dealings (their lack of Federation membership notwithstanding). Furthermore, the station's status as, technically, the property of 
                                  Bajor and thus only nominally a Federation station, sometimes prevented Sisko from prosecuting Quark to the full extent of Federation law; 
                                  ironically, Sisko was not allowed such latitude with criminals who were also Federation citizens, such as his own lover, Kasidy Yates, 
                                  whom Sisko was once obliged to arrest for dealing in illicit replicators yet, on the same occasion.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-center">Rom</h4>
                            <p>Born around 2335, Rom did not have the business acumen typically associated with the Ferengi race; he was described as one who
                                "didn't have the 'lobes' for business". He had a knack for fixing things but, until around 2372, he worked exclusively as a 
                                waiter and stock boy in his brother Quark's bar on Deep Space Nine (DS9). (In the first episode, he was credited only as "Ferengi Pit Boss").
                                Rom frequently displays a lack of confidence, largely due to Quark's habit of belittling him. However, there is evidence to suggest that 
                                Quark was attempting to protect Rom from inevitable failure by preventing him from venturing into business for himself. Nevertheless, 
                                after four years living among Federation and Bajoran citizens on the station, and possibly inspired by his son Nog's admission to 
                                Starfleet (which made him very proud), Rom left the bar to become an engineer in the Bajoran Militia.
                                Odo once described Rom as "an idiot, [who] couldn't fix a straw if it was bent". These opinions, however, were only due to Rom's social 
                                ineptitude and meek, almost subservient, demeanor (largely due to the near-constant verbal and emotional torment he suffers at the hands 
                                of Quark), and stood in stark contrast to his genius as an engineer. This talent allowed him to play an important role in the station's 
                                participation in the Dominion War. In 2373, Rom designed and distributed a self-replicating minefield that blocked access to the Bajoran
                                wormhole and prevented Dominion reinforcements from entering the Alpha Quadrant for several months.
                                His first wife, Prinadora, bore his son Nog. She stayed behind on Ferenginar when Rom first came to Deep Space Nine, but the marriage 
                                was later dissolved after she and her father stole the bulk of his profits. Rom eventually married Leeta, a Bajoran Dabo girl
                                employed at Quark's bar, after a period of doubt about her love after having been burned in his first marriage.</p>
