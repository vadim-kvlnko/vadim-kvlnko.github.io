                  <p>The establishment occupies a central position on the Promenade, extending over three stories with entrances on at least two.
                      Spiral staircases provided pedestrian access between the different levels, and the central portion of flooring of the
                      second and third levels was cut out with railed balconies overlooking the levels below.</p>
              </div>
  
          <div class="col-1">
                 <p> <em> Level 1 </em> - The main entrance to Quark's was on Level 1, together with the bar, various gambling tables and a number of tables and chairs where c
                  ustomers could sit and enjoy their beverages. The main entrance, bar and gambling area were brightly lit, while lighting in the periphery was 
                  more subdued so as to provide a degree of privacy for the business deals and covert exchanges that occurred there.</p>
  
              </div>

              <div class="col-2">
                   <p> <em>Levels 2 and 3 </em> - The upper levels provided more tables and seating, and housed the holosuite arcade. There was also a second-level entrance from the Promenade.
                    Quark's seemed to be the only part of the Promenade that had a third level, and little of it was ever seen on screen. It appeared to comprise only a balcony and walkway.
                    The inside of Quark's was dominated by a large distinctive yellow and red mural and decorative brass poles that extended up through the cut out section of all three levels. 
                    Part of the mural also served as the bar's logo, and was sometimes displayed on information screens embedded into the walls of two large open windows looking out over the Promenade on Level 1.</p>
