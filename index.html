            <h4>Hello Tradition.</h4>
            <p>
                    Quark's takes a time-honoured tradition of hospitality, a sense of history and young, dynamic staff and turns them into a modern irish bar that is accessible, irresistible, even fiercely romantic.’ 
                    We’ve always loved traditional bars. But we’ve also always wanted to bring that tradition into the 25th century. So we kept all that was best about the experience – the warmth, the conviviality, the whole sure-where’s-your-rush? 
                    And we updated everything else, with mind-blowingly good cocktails. Amazing selections of whiskey (and whisky). 
                    Food to diet for. Entertainment. The best crew. The works. So, yes, it’s tradition. But with a zesty twist.
                                
            </p>

                <h4>Meet Tomorrow.</h4>
            <p>
                    Two brothers with just a headful of dreams and stardust in their eyes. 
                    That’s who we elbowed past as we hauled out of jfk, looked around and said, ‘ok, new york. You’ll do.’
                    You see, we’d already come a long way.  One of us was Quark – cocktail virtuoso, walking drinks encyclopedia 
                    and soon to be international bartender of the year.  The other was sean muldoon, ice-obsessive,
                    detail obsessive, and already the creative force behind a world’s best cocktail bar (the merchant, back home in belfast).
                    Two top dogs in search of a rabbit. Then we found one.
